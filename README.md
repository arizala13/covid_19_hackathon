Our application built with flutter is called Community tree. The idea of the application is to create something that enables healthcare workers communicate across the world. Also it helps communities connect by asking for help and volunteering your skills and time.

Community tree is an open source project and we would welcome and love if you want to contribute in anyway possible. An app built for the world by the world.
